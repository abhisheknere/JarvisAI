**Developing a Housing Prediction System using Flask API**

Dear Abhis,

I'm excited to help you develop a housing prediction system using Flask API. Below is a step-by-step guide to create a basic system.

**System Overview:**
The housing prediction system aims to predict the price of a house based on various features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, location, and more. This system will be built using a supervised learning approach, where we will train a model on a dataset of existing houses and their corresponding prices.

**Setup Requirements:**

1. **Flask**: Install Flask (v2.0 or later) on your system.
2. **Pandas**: Install pandas (v1.3 or later) for data manipulation.
3. **NumPy**: Install NumPy (v1.21 or later) for numerical computations.
4. **Scikit-learn**: Install scikit-learn (v1.0 or later) for machine learning.
5. **Matplotlib**: Install Matplotlib (v3.5 or later) for data visualization.

**Step 1: Create a new Flask API project**

Create a new directory called `housing_prediction_api` and navigate to it in your terminal. Run the following command to create a new Flask API project:
```bash
flask new housing_prediction_api
```
This will create a new directory called `housing_prediction_api` with the basic structure for a Flask API project.

**Step 2: Install required libraries**

Run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
**Step 3: Create a new dataset**

Create a new file called `housing_data.csv` and add the following data:
```markdown
id,price,bedrooms,bathrooms,sqft,location
1,200000,3,2,1500,San Francisco
2,300000,4,3,2000,San Francisco
3,250000,5,2,2500,San Francisco
4,180000,2,1,1000,San Jose
5,220000,3,2,1200,San Jose
6,280000,4,3,1800,San Jose
7,200000,3,2,1500,San Francisco
8,300000,4,3,2000,San Francisco
9,250000,5,2,2500,San Francisco
10,180000,2,1,1000,San Jose
```
This data contains 10 rows, each representing a house with its corresponding features and price.

**Step 4: Create a new Flask API route**

Create a new file called `app.py` and add the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

# Define the feature columns
feature_cols = ['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft', 'location']

# Define the target column
target_col = 'price'

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df[feature_cols], df[target_col], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Define a new Flask API route
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get the input data from the request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Extract the input features
    bedrooms = data['bedrooms']
    bathrooms = data['bathrooms']
    sqft = data['sqft']
    location = data['location']

    # Create a new input array
    input_array = np.array([[bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, location]])

    # Make a prediction using the model
    prediction = model.predict(input_array)

    # Return the prediction as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This code loads the dataset, defines the feature and target columns, splits the data into training and testing sets, creates a linear regression model, trains the model on the training data, makes predictions on the testing data, evaluates the model using the mean squared error, defines a new Flask API route, and returns the prediction as a JSON response.

**Step 5: Run the Flask API**

Run the following command to run the Flask API:
```bash
flask run
```
This will start the Flask API on port 5000.

**Step 6: Make a prediction using the Flask API**

Use a tool like `curl` to make a prediction using the Flask API:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bedrooms": 3, "bathrooms": 2, "sqft": 1500, "location": "San Francisco"}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```
This will make a prediction using the Flask API and print the prediction to the console.

Congratulations! You have now developed a basic housing prediction system using Flask API.

Best regards,
Abhis.
