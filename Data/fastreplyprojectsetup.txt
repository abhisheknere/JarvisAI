**Fast Reply Project Setup**

Dear Abhis,

I'm excited to help you set up a fast reply project. Below is a step-by-step guide to get you started.

**Project Overview:**
The fast reply project aims to develop a simple application that allows users to send quick responses to frequently asked questions. This project will be built using a modern web development framework, focusing on speed, efficiency, and user experience.

**Setup Requirements:**

1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (v14 or later) on your system.
2. **npm**: Install npm (v6 or later) as the package manager for Node.js.
3. **Code Editor**: Choose a code editor of your preference (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).
4. **Git**: Install Git on your system for version control.

**Step 1: Create a new project directory**

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new project directory:
```bash
mkdir fast-reply-project
cd fast-reply-project
```
**Step 2: Initialize a new npm project**

Run the following command to initialize a new npm project:
```bash
npm init -y
```
This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.

**Step 3: Install required dependencies**

Install the following dependencies:
```bash
npm install express cors body-parser
```
These dependencies will enable us to create a web server, handle CORS requests, and parse JSON bodies.

**Step 4: Create a new Express.js app**

Create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
This code sets up an Express.js app, enables CORS, and starts the server on port 3000.

**Step 5: Add a route for the fast reply feature**

Create a new file called `routes.js` and add the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/fast-reply', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: 'This is a fast reply feature.',
  });
});

module.exports = router;
```
This code adds a new route for the fast reply feature, which returns a JSON response.

**Step 6: Add the fast reply route to the app**

Update the `app.js` file to include the fast reply route:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const router = require('./routes');

const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use('/fast-reply', router);

const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
This code adds the fast reply route to the app.

**Step 7: Start the server**

Run the following command to start the server:
```bash
node app.js
```
This will start the server on port 3000.

**Step 8: Test the fast reply feature**

Open a new terminal window and run the following command to test the fast reply feature:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/fast-reply
```
This should return a JSON response with the message "This is a fast reply feature."

Congratulations! You have now set up a fast reply project using Node.js, Express.js, and npm.

Best regards,
Abhis.
